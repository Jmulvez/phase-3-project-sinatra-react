## Movie Night Movie Watchlist

Movie Night Watchlist is a convenient way to save interesting movies in an easy to access list for the next night you want to just lay around with a bag of popcorn and be a lazy couch potato.

## Installation

CD into the "backend" folder first and run the "bundle install" command to install backend dependencies then run "bundle exec rake server" to get the database up and running. Next, CD into the "frontend" folder and run the command "npm install" to install the frontend dependencies. Finally, while still in the frontend folder, run "npm start" to run the application in your browser.

## Built Using

## Future Updates

Plans to add login authentication so users may have their own personal lists assosiated with the current user that is signed in. Also plans to add commenting feature to react to other users lists (and steal some of their movies).
